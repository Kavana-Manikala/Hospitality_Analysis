# Hospitality_Analysis
Hospitality analysis involves examining data related to hotel operations, guest experiences, and financial performance to optimize services, increase occupancy, and enhance customer satisfaction.

The visualizations and dashboard created supports the findings in the form of key insights and different KPIs like:

âœ…Occupancy Rate: Percentage of available rooms that are occupied over a given period.
âœ…Average Daily Rate (ADR): Average revenue earned per occupied room.
âœ…Revenue Per Available Room (RevPAR): Total room revenue divided by the number of available rooms.
âœ…Customer Satisfaction Score: Guest ratings aggregated to measure service quality.
âœ…Booking Source Distribution: Breakdown of bookings by direct channels, online travel agencies (OTAs), and corporate clients.

ðŸ“ŒRecommendations:

1. Optimize Pricing Strategy: Use dynamic pricing to adjust rates based on demand and increase revenue.
2. Enhance Guest Experience: Implement personalized services and amenities to boost customer satisfaction scores.
3. Expand Marketing Efforts: Target promotions based on booking source trends to maximize occupancy during low-demand periods.
4. Leverage Data for Upselling: Identify opportunities to upsell premium services, such as room upgrades and dining packages, based on guest preferences.
